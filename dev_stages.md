DealmyArea Development Stages

This document outlines a step-by-step development plan for building DealmyArea as a solo full-stack developer. The plan leverages best practices and easy-to-implement libraries, focusing on frontend and backend development using Next.js, Firebase, NextUI, Radix UI, Tremor, Stripe, and Python.

Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Features (Weeks 1-4)

1. Project Initialization
Set Up Version Control
Initialize a Git repository on GitHub.
Configure .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files.
Initialize Next.js Application
Create a new Next.js app with TypeScript support:
npx create-next-app@latest dealmyarea --typescript
Install Dependencies
Install UI libraries and Firebase:
npm install @nextui-org/react @radix-ui/react tremor firebase stripe
Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file for API keys and sensitive data.
2. Firebase Integration
Create Firebase Project
Set up a new project in Firebase Console.
Enable Authentication Providers
Activate Google, Facebook, Apple ID, and Email/Password authentication.
Set Up Firestore Database
Initialize Firestore for data storage.
Integrate Firebase SDK
Initialize Firebase in the Next.js app:
// firebase.js
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';
import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';

const firebaseConfig = {
  // Your Firebase configuration
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const auth = getAuth(app);
const db = getFirestore(app);

export { auth, db };
3. User Authentication

Display user's current location on the map.
5. Price Comparison Dashboard
Design Dashboard
Use Tremor components for charts and data visualization.
Data Fetching
Structure Firestore collections for stores and products.
Fetch and display price comparisons across stores.
Display Comparisons
Highlight lowest prices and trending deals.
Phase 2: Advanced Functionality (Weeks 5-8)

6. Amazon Affiliate Integration
